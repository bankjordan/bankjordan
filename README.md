# My development philosophy


Development is a way of expressing a life philosophy. 
I am passionate about the breadth of intellectual possibilities that development engineering can offer. From my point of view, designing a web application is not just about reading user stories and implementing features but expressing your creativity and being the actor of a relevant project within a passionate team.

Being a junior, learning is very important to me, I am constantly learning ingenious concepts of web development long before the technologies. I do my best to write clean, maintainable and optimized code and work in the best possible conditions. Whether it's about security, accessibility or optimization. So I question each of my design practices and I don't just follow recommendations and best practices but I really understand the stakes of the mentioned topics in a real context with social issues

# Backend Skills

As a junior developer, I have to think about server side issues. That's why, well before thinking about the programming language, I do my best to master 100% the key concepts.

# Frontend Skills

The front end is also important, the appearance of a site makes the brand image of a company. For me, a web page should not only be beautiful, but also clearly define the product solution and especially respect the standards of accessibility, optimization and referencing.
